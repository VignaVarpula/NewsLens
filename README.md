NewsLens is a smart news application built with FastAPI that lets users search for real-time news based on their queries, selected date, language, and news category. It gets news from global sources using the Mediastack API. The app summarizes each news article using an AI model (BART) and can translate both the userâ€™s question and the summary into different languages using Google Translate. It also turns the summary into audio using gTTS, so users can listen to it or download it. NewsLens has a user-friendly HTML interface that shows clean news cards with the summary, audio, and original news link. It also avoids showing duplicate results, supports pagination for easier browsing, and automatically deletes old audio files to keep things running smoothly.
